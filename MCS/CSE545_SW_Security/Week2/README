Steps to Install/Make:
1. Extract the archive using tar -zxvf submission.tar.gz
2. make
3. You will see a new executable file generated normal_web_server
 

Steps to Run:
1. Execute normal_web_server with PORT number as an argument
   e.g.  ./normal_web_server 8080
2. Then the web server can be accessed http://HOST:8080
3. The program will always return HTTP 404 if the URL doesn't have /exec/
4. After exec if we pas any UNIX command, the server will execute that command and return the Output to the client in HTTP 200 OK respone
   e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8080/exec/ls will return the content of the folder where the normal_web_server executable is in.

The Working Logic
1. The backdoor has been created using Simple C socket AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM
2. We used the argv to get the PORT number from the command line argument and ussed it to create the Server struct
3. Then we did bind the socket on that Address
4. The program then listens on that socket
5. When a client connects to it, it accepts the connection and then, the following things happen
 a. The code checks the first line in the messsage read from the client
 b. If the line doesn't start with GET then, respond with Invalid type only GET allowed
 c. Otherwise, get the first line and get the URL
 d. If the URL doesn't have /exec/ , send 404 HTTP response
 e. Else , get everything after /exec/ and create a Fstream with POPEN to execute the command and write back the stream to the socket with HTTP 200 OK header

 The HTTP 200 OK header:
                              "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n"
                              "Content-Type: text/html\n"
                              "Accept-Ranges: bytes\n"
                              "Connection: close\n"
                              "\n";
The HTTP 404 NOTFOUND header:
                                    "HTTP/1.1 404 NOTFOUND\n"
                                    "Content-Type: text/html\n"
                                    "Accept-Ranges: bytes\n"
                                    "Connection: close\n"
                                    "\n";
